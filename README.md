# Weather App
This is an iPhone weather application.  It takes a city name as input and displays weather information (minimum, maximum, and current temperatures in Fahrenheit; humidity) received from openweathermap.org as well as a corresponding weather image.  The CoreLocation framework is used to detect and provide the weather data based on the userâ€™s current location information.
